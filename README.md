# MyLocations-UIKit

MyLocations-UIKit is an iOS application developed using Swift and UIKit that allows users to save and manage their favorite locations. The app utilizes Core Location to obtain GPS coordinates, MapKit to display locations on a map, and Core Data for persistent storage.

## Features

- **Save Current Location**: Capture and store your current GPS coordinates with a single tap.
- **View Saved Locations**: Browse and manage a list of all your saved spots.
- **Map Integration**: Visualize your locations on an interactive map using MapKit.
- **Photo Attachments**: Attach a photo to each location.
- **Persistent Storage**: All data is stored securely using Core Data, ensuring your locations are saved between sessions.
